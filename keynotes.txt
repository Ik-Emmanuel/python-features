=============== data classes, pydantic, attr 
- pydantic is used if object validation is important 
- dataclass feature are tied to the version of python 
- attrs is a more complex version of dataclass ( its a superset of dataclass)
    - allows validation 
    - better comparison between objects 



-- classes 
    - behaviours oriented/driven classes = inheritance or strategy design pattern
    - data containers  oriented classes = data classes
